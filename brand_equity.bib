              referred to as brand personality. Here we combine newly available
              machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data to
              characterize the set of processes that give rise to these
              associations. We show that brand personality traits can be
              captured by the weighted activity across a widely distributed set
              of brain regions previously implicated in reasoning, imagery, and
              affective processing. That is, as opposed to being constructed via
              reflective processes, brand personality traits appear to exist a
              priori inside the minds of consumers, such that we were able to
              predict what brand a person is thinking about based solely on the
              relationship between brand personality associations and brain
              activity. These findings represent an important advance in the

              risk and return. Research has focused on linking marketing
              activities and resource deployments with returns but has largely
              neglected marketing's role in determining risk. Yet the
              theoretical literature asserts that investments in market-based
              assets, such as brands, should lead to reductions in firm risk.
              Adopting risk measures that are well established in the finance
              literature, the authors use credit ratings to capture debt-holder
              risk and the standard deviation of stock returns to measure
              equity-holder risk, which they then decompose into systematic and
              unsystematic equity risk. The authors examine the impact of
              consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) on firm risk using data
              covering 252 firms from EquiTrend, COMPUSTAT, and the Center for
              Research in Security Prices over the 2000–2006 period. They find
              that a firm's CBBE is associated with firm risk and explains
              variance in the risk measures beyond that explained by existing
              finance models (i.e., it has “risk relevance”). They also find
              that CBBE has a stronger role in predicting firm-specific
              unsystematic risk than systematic risk but that it also has a
              particularly strong role in protecting equity holders from
              downside systematic risk. The results have clear economic
              significance and suggest that managers should make brand
              management part of the firm's risk management strategy and protect
              or even increase CBBE investments during periods of economic
              uncertainty. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

              purchasing and usage decisions. Thus, they constitute a
              substantial intangible asset for most companies. In order to
              maximize this asset, current research has developed various brand
              equity models. However, the majority of these base their approach
              on an outside-in perspective by focusing on buyer perceptions of
              the brand and their related buying behavior. An integrated
              approach including for example employees as an important internal
              source of brand equity, has so far received little attention. The
              following paper aims to close this gap by developing a new
              integrated brand equity model. This research explores the sources

              framework for understanding and managing brand meaning.
              Specifically, we provide an overarching theory of branding, with
              associated testable propositions. While traditional brand
              management theory focuses primarily on brand-related marketing
              communications, the role that the knowledge base of the recipient
              plays in interpreting these communications is generally
              overlooked. This may explain the multiple and sometimes dissonant
              brand meanings that arise despite consistent, simple and memorable
              brand communications. The theory of mutual knowledge stresses that
              assonance of meaning will only arise between the sender and
              recipient of a set of communications when both parties share a
              mutual knowledge base. Thus, to co-create brand meaning,
              organizations must understand the knowledge base of different
              stakeholder groups. Effective brand co-creation combines the
              management of both communications and stakeholders' mutual

               product features to predict consumption benefits. The first
               learning process is a relatively unfocused process in which all
               stimulus elements get cross‐referenced for later retrieval. This
               process is backward looking and consistent with human associative
               memory (HAM) models. The second learning process requires that a
               benefit be the focus of prediction during learning. It assumes
               feature‐benefit associations change only to the extent that the
               expected performance of the product does not match the
               experienced performance of the product. This process is forward
               looking and consistent with adaptive network models. The
               importance of this two‐process theory is most apparent when a
               product has multiple features. During HAM learning, each
               feature‐benefit association will develop independently. During
               adaptive learning, features will compete to predict benefits and,
               thus, feature‐benefit associations will develop interdependently.
               We find adaptive learning of feature‐benefit associations when
               consumers are motivated to learn to predict a benefit (e.g.,
               because it is perceived to have hedonic relevance) but find HAM

               objectives and focus on different stakeholder groups. Marketers
               want to create sales impact. Finance executives are concerned
               about the financial health of the firm. As a result, both worlds
               tend to be rather disconnected in their daily business. We argue
               that this does not reflect the dynamics of the firm where
               important marketing and financial metrics in fact interact. As
               long as marketing and finance officers do not fully appreciate
               the interplay of their key metrics, their decisions are likely to
               be suboptimal. This article proposes a simultaneous equation
               model that reflects the interaction of marketing and
               finance-domain variables in the value creation process. We focus
               on brand-building activities and the attraction of capital as
               major tasks of marketing and finance officers. Our model shows
               how advertising and other investments increase customer-based

               credit spread and ultimately elevates the level of financial
               resources. Based on a broad sample of 155 firms covering various
               B2C industries, we test for the empirical relevance of our model.
               We also assess the practical significance of our results by

              extent to which BRiC differs across categories and countries have
              been neglected. The authors introduce the concept of BRiC (a
              category-level measure, not a brand-level measure). They develop a
              conceptual framework to measure BRiC and the drivers of BRiC, test
              the framework empirically with a sample of more than 5700
              consumers, and show how the construct varies across 20 product
              categories and five countries (France, Japan, Spain, the United
              Kingdom, and the United States). The results suggest a high
              validity of the proposed BRiC measure and show substantial
              differences between categories and countries. A replication study
              two-and-a-half years later confirms the psychometric properties of
              the suggested scale and shows remarkable stability of the
              findings. The findings have important implications for the
              management of brand investments.",

              empirically demonstrates its significance on executive pay.
              Executives value being associated with strong brands and,
              therefore, accept substantially lower pay at firms that own strong
              brands. Consistent with identity theory, this effect is stronger

              value and make use of strong brands in pay negotiations that are

                   that match their personal needs and preferences. To help
                   address questions that can't easily be answered by reading
                   others' reviews, some review websites also allow users to
                   pose questions to the community via a question-answering (QA)
                   system. As one would expect, just as opinions diverge among
                   different reviewers, answers to such questions may also be
                   subjective, opinionated, and divergent. This means that
                   answering such questions automatically is quite different
                   from traditional QA tasks, where it is assumed that a single
                   `correct' answer is available. While recent work introduced
                   the idea of question-answering using product reviews, it did
                   not account for two aspects that we consider in this paper:
                   (1) Questions have multiple, often divergent, answers, and
                   this full spectrum of answers should somehow be used to train
                   the system; and (2) What makes a `good' answer depends on the
                   asker and the answerer, and these factors should be
                   incorporated in order for the system to be more personalized.
                   Here we build a new QA dataset with 800 thousand
                   questions---and over 3.1 million answers---and show that
                   explicitly accounting for personalization and ambiguity leads
                   both to quantitatively better answers, but also a more
                   nuanced view of the range of supporting, but subjective,
                   opinions.",

                   nonlinear operations on co-occurrence statistics, and have
                   hand-tuned hyperparameters and reweighting methods. This
                   paper proposes a new generative model, a dynamic version of
                   the log-linear topic model of~\citet{mnih2007three}. The
                   methodological novelty is to use the prior to compute closed

                   theoretical justification for nonlinear models like PMI,
                   word2vec, and GloVe, as well as some hyperparameter choices.
                   It also helps explain why low-dimensional semantic embeddings
                   contain linear algebraic structure that allows solution of

               relative impact of brand communication on brand equity through
               social media as compared to traditional media. In a juxtaposition
               of different industries it aims at: investigating whether both
               communication instruments have an impact on consumer‐based brand
               equity; comparing the effect sizes of these two communication
               instruments; and separating the effects of firm‐created and
               user‐generated social media
               communication.Design/methodology/approach – A total of 393 data
               sets from three different industries, namely tourism,
               telecommunications, and pharmaceuticals, were generated using a
               standardized online‐survey. Structural equation modeling was used
               in the analysis of the data obtained to investigate the interplay
               of social media and traditional media in general, as well as in
               an examination of industry‐specific differences.Findings – The
               results of the empirical study show that both traditional
               communications and social media communications have a significant
               impact on brand equity. While traditional media has a stronger
               impact on brand awareness, social media communications strongly
               influence brand image. Firm‐created social media communication is
               shown to have an important impact on functional brand image,
               while user‐generated social media communication exerts a major
               influence on hedonic brand image. Furthermore, the present study
               highlights significant differences between the industries under
               investigation.Originality/value – The research described in this
               paper is pioneering in that it juxtaposes the impacts of social
               media and traditional media on brand equity – a topic of
               increasing interest to firms in the era of Facebook and Twitter
               but so far largely uninvestigated. Moreover, the differentiation
               between firm‐created and user‐generated social media
               communication, which is gaining increasingly in importance, as
               companies see their brand marketing power devolve to the consumer
               through social media platforms, offers valuable insights to
               marketing practitioners and academics.",

               response on the basis of their prior expectations about the firm.

               – This paper, based on cognitive psychology, takes a recently
               developed brand mapping approach and uses its features, along
               with network analysis measures designed specifically by the
               authors for this particular analysis, to produce a novel measure
               of brand association strength. Findings – Traditional network
               analysis measures (e.g. number of associations, density) neglect
               to take into account the underlying structure of consumers '
               brand associations as reflected in concept maps. The authors use

               that both number of associations and a modified density measure
               taking account of the special structure of concept maps can be
               used to generate an intuitive and readily understood measure of

               conventional scale items to develop a strategic overview of a
               brand's associations and to depict brands' strategic meaning in a
               comprehensive visual presentation.Findings – The authors show,
               via an example featuring peanut butter brands, how their
               methodology effectively uncovers associations that the market has
               for the brands and how strong, unique, relevant, and favorable
               those associations are.Research limitations/implications – This
               methodology is most appropriate for four to six brands at a
               time.Practical implications – The strategic brand association map
               process demonstrated provides managers with a very clear,
               consumer‐driven, strategic view of the associations their brand
               has, and how those associations may (or may not) be serving to
               differentiate their brand. Additionally, these strategic brand
               association maps serve as an excellent diagnostic as to the
               overall health of a brand and can provide actionable insight for
               better understanding strategic reasons why a particular brand may
               be under‐performing against expectations.Originality/value –
               Brand associations are one of the fundamental cornerstones of
               brand value. Brand associations serve to differentiate and create
               meaning for brands. Better understanding and managing a brand's
               associations is a fundamental role of brand managers. This
               process illustrates a new way to give brand managers strategic,
               consumer‐driven insight into their brand's associative network.",

               complements inferred from market structure. In this article, the

               visualization of market structure by automatically eliciting
               product attributes and brand's relative positions from online

               reflected in customer reviews, rather than that of manufacturers.
               Second, the approach runs automatically. Third, the process
               supports rather than supplants managerial judgment by reinforcing
               or augmenting attributes and dimensions found through traditional
               surveys and focus groups. The authors test the approach on six

               levels (e.g., tentative language), implicit sentiment expressions
               (e.g., commissive language), and discourse patterns (e.g.,
               incoherence) on overall consumer sentiment (i.e., star ratings).
               In two follow-up studies, we demonstrate that these speech act
               features also influence the readers’ behavior and are
               generalizable to other social media contexts, such as Twitter and
               Facebook. We contribute to research on consumer sentiment
               analysis by offering a more nuanced understanding of consumer

              representing a rich source of consumer information on a wide range
              of product categories (e.g., wines and hotels). Importantly, a
              product review reflects not only the perception and preference for
              a product, but also the acuity, bias, and writing style of the
              reviewer. This reviewer aspect has been overlooked in past studies
              that have drawn inferences about brands from online product
              reviews. Our framework combines ontology learning-based text
              mining and psychometric techniques to translate online product
              reviews into a product positioning map, while accounting for the
              idiosyncratic responses and writing styles of individual reviewers
              or a manageable number of reviewer groups (i.e., meta-reviewers).
              Our empirical illustrations using wine and hotel reviews
              demonstrate that a product review reveals information about the
              reviewer (for the wine example with a small number of expert
              reviewers) or the meta-reviewer (for the hotel example with an
              enormous number of reviewers reduced to a manageable number of
              meta-reviewers), as well as about the product under review. From a
              managerial perspective, product managers can use our framework
              focusing on meta-reviewers (e.g., traveler types and hotel
              reservation websites in our hotel example) as a way to obtain

               differential roles for product success, this study offers a
               theoretical framework of the influence of these two types of WOM,
               drawing from consumer information search theory and diffusion
               theory. The tests of the proposed framework use a longitudinal
               data set of video game sales and weekly information gathered from
               microblogs (i.e., over 13 million tweets from Twitter) and
               consumer reviews (i.e., more than 17,000 Amazon consumer
               reviews). Analyzing a system of equations provides evidence that
               the influence of microblogs and consumer reviews on new product
               success changes over time. Prior to launch, the volumes of

               microblogs is initially influential, then loses impact, whereas
               the impact of the volume of consumer reviews continues to grow.
               The valence of consumer reviews gains significance only near the

               response to a sales promotion? If not, how do the different
               consumer benefits of a sales promotion influence its
               effectiveness? To address the first question, this research
               builds a framework of the multiple consumer benefits of a sales
               promotion. Through a series of measurement studies, the authors
               find that monetary and nonmonetary promotions provide consumers
               with different levels of three hedonic benefits (opportunities
               for value expression, entertainment, and exploration) and three
               utilitarian benefits (savings, higher product quality, and
               improved shopping convenience). To address the second question,
               the authors develop a benefit congruency framework, which argues
               that a sales promotion?s effectiveness is determined by the
               utilitarian or hedonic nature of the benefits it delivers and the
               congruence these benefits have with the promoted product. Among
               other results, two choice experiments show that, as predicted for
               high-equity brands, monetary promotions are more effective for
               utilitarian products than for hedonic products. The authors then

               effect of parent brand salience, branding strategy and extension
               innovativeness positioning on the extent of transfer of
               associations from the parent brand to a brand
               extension.Design/methodology/approach – A field experiment based
               on a 2×2×2 between‐subjects completely randomized factorial
               design involving 808 consumers was conducted. Three factors were
               manipulated: parent brand salience, product innovativeness, and
               the branding strategy.Findings – The paper finds that, in
               addition to the main effects of salience and the branding
               strategy, all three factors jointly influence the extent of
               transfer of associations from a parent brand to an
               extension.Research limitations/implications – Despite the
               external validity of a natural experiment, some uncontrolled
               factors may have influenced the results. Also, transfer was
               assessed within time constraints (i.e. the time to complete the
               survey). The “duration” of any transfer effect is likely to be
               related to the ad exposure, which could be tested in future
               research.Practical implications – The findings are important for
               line extension development since they suggest that the launch of
               an extension can be designed to maximize or minimize transfer of
               brand associations from the parent brand to a new line extension,
               depending on the specific marketing objectives for the parent
               brand and/or extension.Originality/value – This paper fills an
               important gap in the literature in terms of identifying product
               innovativeness, parent brand salience and the branding strategy
               as synergistic factors affecting transfer of brand associations

              represent a property that occurs in multiple concepts. Thus, a
              global symbol represents mane across HORSE, PONY, and LION.
              Alternatively, perceptual theories of knowledge, as well as
              distributed representational systems, assume that properties take
              different local forms in different concepts. Thus, different local
              forms of mane exist for HORSE, PONY, and LION, each capturing the
              specific form that mane takes in its respective concept. Three
              experiments used the property verification task to assess whether
              properties are represented globally or locally (e.g., Does a PONY
              have mane?). If a single global form represents a property, then
              verifying it in any concept should increase its accessibility and
              speed its verification later in any other concept. Verifying mane
              for PONY should benefit as much from having verified mane for LION
              earlier as from verifying mane for HORSE. If properties are
              represented locally, however, verifying a property should only
              benefit from verifying a similar form earlier. Verifying mane for
              PONY should only benefit from verifying mane for HORSE, not from
              verifying mane for LION. Findings from three experiments strongly
              supported local property representation and ruled out the
              interpretation that object similarity was responsible (e.g., the
              greater overall similarity between HORSE and PONY than between
              LION and PONY). The findings further suggest that property
              representation and verification are complicated phenomena,

               source of information for customers making product choices
               online. The existing literature typically incorporates the impact
               of product reviews on sales based on numeric variables
               representing the valence and volume of reviews. In this paper, we
               posit that the information embedded in product reviews cannot be
               captured by a single scalar value. Rather, we argue that product
               reviews are multifaceted, and hence the textual content of
               product reviews is an important determinant of consumers'
               choices, over and above the valence and volume of reviews. To
               demonstrate this, we use text mining to incorporate review text
               in a consumer choice model by decomposing textual reviews into
               segments describing different product features. We estimate our
               model based on a unique data set from Amazon containing sales
               data and consumer review data for two different groups of
               products (digital cameras and camcorders) over a 15-month period.
               We alleviate the problems of data sparsity and of omitted

               rare textual opinions based on pointwise mutual information and
               using externally imposed review semantics. This paper
               demonstrates how textual data can be used to learn consumers'
               relative preferences for different product features and also how
               text can be used for predictive modeling of future changes in

               leads to many of the same limitations as direct elicitation.

               Scholars have recently proposed the potential of designing
               multidimensional rating systems to better convey information on
               multiple dimensions of products. This study investigates whether
               and how multidimensional rating systems affect consumer
               satisfaction (measured by product ratings), based on both
               observational data and two randomized experiments. Our
               identification strategy of the observational study hinges on a
               natural experiment on TripAdvisor when the website started to
               allow consumers to rate multiple dimensions of the restaurants,
               as opposed to only providing an overall rating, in January 2009.
               We further obtain rating data on the same set of restaurants from
               Yelp, which controls for the unobserved restaurant quality over
               time and allows us to identify the causal effect using a
               difference-in-differences approach. Results from the econometric
               analyses show that ratings in a single-dimensional rating system
               have a downward trend and a higher dispersion, whereas ratings in
               a multidimensional rating system are significantly higher and
               convergent. Findings from two randomized experiments suggest that
               the multidimensional rating system helps consumers find products
               that better fit their preferences and increases the confidence of
               their choices. We also show that the observed results cannot be
               explained by the priming effect due to rating system interface or
               a list of other alternative explanations. The combined evidence
               from the natural experiment and randomized experiments support
               the view that the multidimensional rating system enhances rating

               property is much stronger than other graph properties such as
               connectivity and minimum degree, in that one can construct graphs
               with high connectivity and minimum degree but low robustness. In
               this paper, we investigate the robustness of common random graph
               models for complex networks (Erdos-Rényi, geometric random, and
               preferential attachment graphs). We show that the notions of
               connectivity and robustness coincide on these random graph

               Erdos-Rényi model, cannot be very different in the geometric

               each other and link the brand with rich contextual and
               consumption experiences. However, previous articles in marketing
               research have concentrated on deriving brand information from
               textual user-generated content and have largely not considered
               brand-related images. The analysis of brand-related images yields
               at least two challenges. First, the content displayed in images
               is heterogeneous, and second, images rarely show what users think
               and feel in or about the situations displayed. To meet these
               challenges, this article presents a two-step approach that
               involves collecting, labeling, clustering, aggregating, mapping,
               and analyzing brand-related user-generated content. The collected
               data are brand-related images, caption texts, and social tags

              relative brand importance (computed from brand choice models such

              Allstate--a leading insurance company--and its leading competitor,
              which compete in multiple categories. The model captures the
              brand's spillover effects from one category to another. In
              addition, we identify the dimensions that drive a brand's image,

              shareholder value, and build a decision support simulator for the
              focal brand. Our model provides reliable estimates of brand

              long-term positive influence on brand equity, which is
              significantly positively related to shareholder value. The model,

               features can be a powerful driver of choice behavior. They
               conjecture that consumers often hold expectations about the
               features that choice alternatives have in common, and they
               demonstrate that presenting (vs. omitting information about) a
               common feature increases the choice probability of the
               alternative that would have been expected to perform worse on the
               common feature, given its performance on differentiating
               features. This effect occurs because performance on the common

               expectation about which product should perform best on that

               a significant impact on the contagion properties of the
               subsequent adoption process, and we propose a method for
               uncovering the degree distribution of the adopter network
               underlying the dissemination process, based exclusively on
               limited early-stage penetration data. In this paper we propose
               and empirically validate a unified network-based growth model
               that links network structure and penetration patterns.
               Specifically, using external sources of information, we confirm
               that each network degree distribution identified by the model
               matches the actual social network that is underlying the
               dissemination process. We also show empirically that the same
               method can be used to forecast adoption using an estimation of
               the degree distribution and the diffusion parameters at an early
               stage (15\%) of the penetration process. We confirm that these
               forecasts are significantly superior to those of three benchmark
               models of diffusion. Our empirical analysis indicates that under
               heavily right-skewed degree distribution conditions (such as
               scale-free networks), the majority of adopters (in some cases, up
               to 75\%) join the process after the sales peak. This strong
               asymmetry is a result of the unique interaction between the

  abstract      = "This paper introduces BLaIR, a series of pretrained sentence
                   embedding models specialized for recommendation scenarios.
                   BLaIR is trained to learn correlations between item metadata
                   and potential natural language context, which is useful for
                   retrieving and recommending items. To pretrain BLaIR, we
                   collect Amazon Reviews 2023, a new dataset comprising over
                   570 million reviews and 48 million items from 33 categories,
                   significantly expanding beyond the scope of previous
                   versions. We evaluate the generalization ability of BLaIR
                   across multiple domains and tasks, including a new task named
                   complex product search, referring to retrieving relevant
                   items given long, complex natural language contexts.
                   Leveraging large language models like ChatGPT, we
                   correspondingly construct a semi-synthetic evaluation set,
                   Amazon-C4. Empirical results on the new task, as well as
                   conventional retrieval and recommendation tasks, demonstrate
                   that BLaIR exhibit strong text and item representation
                   capacity. Our datasets, code, and checkpoints are available
