               gamma/Gompertz distribution (G/G). The advantage of this model
               relative to the well-known Pareto distribution is twofold: (i)
               its probability density function can exhibit a mode at zero or an
               interior mode, and (ii) it can be skewed to the right or to the
               left. We combine the G/G with a negative binomial distribution
               (NBD) and obtain the moments of the distribution of the number of
               transactions over (0, T] and (T, T+T*]. Out of six data sets, the
               G/G/NBD model provides a notable improvement in the
               log-likelihood over the Pareto/NBD model in four data sets. It
               can indicate substantial differences in expected residual
               lifetimes compared to the Pareto/NBD and induce a retention
               rather than acquisition policy. On the average, the G/G/NBD

              requires forecasting customers' future purchases. Existing
              stochastic CLV models for this purpose generally make the
              following assumptions: 1) purchase behavior of customers can be
              described by purchase frequency and the average monetary value of
              transactions, 2) customers keep the same purchase behavior pattern
              over time, 3) purchase frequency and monetary value are
              independent, and 4) customers are active during a limited period
              of time after which they permanently defect. We develop a new
              stochastic model that relaxes these four assumptions. First, in
              addition to the number of transactions and its monetary values, we
              also model purchase incidence decisions (i.e. whether or not to
              purchase). Second, our partially hidden Markov truncated–NBD-GG
              (PHM/TNBD-GG) model allows dynamic purchase patterns, dependence
              between purchase frequency and monetary value, and customers to
              become active after a few periods of temporary inactivity.
              Validation of our model on two datasets demonstrates that if
              assumptions 1 to 4 of existing stochastic models are violated our
              model produces more accurate forecasts of future customer

               basis. These include (1) companies for whom transactions can only
               occur at fixed regular intervals, (2) firms that frequently
               associate transactions with specific events (e.g., a charity that
               records whether supporters respond to a particular appeal), and
               (3) organizations that choose to utilize discrete reporting
               periods even though the transactions can occur at any time.
               Furthermore, many of these businesses operate in a noncontractual
               setting, so they have a difficult time differentiating between
               those customers who have ended their relationship with the firm
               versus those who are in the midst of a long hiatus between
               transactions. We develop a model to predict future purchasing
               patterns for a customer base that can be described by these
               structural characteristics. Our beta-geometric/beta-Bernoulli
               (BG/BB) model captures both of the underlying behavioral
               processes (i.e., customers' purchasing while ?alive? and time
               until each customer permanently ?dies?). The model is easy to
               implement in a standard spreadsheet environment and yields
               relatively simple closed-form expressions for the expected number
               of future transactions conditional on past observed behavior (and
               other quantities of managerial interest). We apply this

               organization located in the midwestern United States. Our

               constructs in marketing activities, such as valuation of service
               subscribers and resource allocation. Although extant approaches
               have been proposed to relate service churn to external factors,
               such as reported satisfaction, marketing-mix activities, and so
               on, managers often face situations in which the only information
               available is the duration for which subscribers have had service.
               In such cases, can they forecast service churn and understand the
               contributing factors, which may allow for subsequent
               intervention? The authors propose a framework to examine factors
               that may underlie service retention in a contractual setting.
               Specifically, they use a model of retention that accounts for (1)
               duration dependence, (2) promotional effects, (3) subscriber
               heterogeneity, (4) cross-cohort effects, and (5) calendar-time
               effects (e.g., seasonality).Then, they apply the framework to
               subscription databases of seven services offered by a
               telecommunications provider, mirroring the format commonly used
               to forecast future service churn (and to make managerial
               decisions). Across all seven services, the inclusion of
               promotional effects always improves the forecast accuracy of
               retention behavior, whereas including cross-cohort effects does
               not significantly improve it. In five of the services, customer
               heterogeneity, calendar-time effects, and duration dependence
               also contribute to improved forecasts. The authors use these
               results to understand how the expected value of a subscription
               differs across model specifications. They find considerable
               variation across model specifications, indicating that model
               misspecification can affect resource allocation decisions and
               other marketing efforts that are important to a firm.",

               the calculation of expected customer lifetime value (CLV) are not
               applicable in a noncontractual setting. Using the data presented
               in the case (a series of annual histograms showing the aggregate
               distribution of purchases for two different cohorts of customers
               newly ?acquired? by a catalog marketer), it is a simple exercise
               to compute an estimate of ?expected 5 year CLV.? If we wish to
               arrive at an estimate of CLV that includes the customer's ?life?
               beyond five years or are interested in, say, sorting out the
               purchasing process (while ?alive?) from the attrition process, we
               need to use a formal model of buying behavior that can be applied
               on such coarse data. To tackle this problem, we utilize the
               Pareto/NBD model developed by Schmittlein, Morrison, and Colombo
               (1987). However, existing analytical results do not allow us to
               estimate the model parameters using the data summaries presented
               in the case. We therefore derive an expression that enables us to
               do this.The resulting parameter estimates and subsequent
               calculations offer useful insights that could not have been
               obtained without the formal model. For instance, we were able to
               decompose the lifetime value into four factors, namely purchasing
               while active, dropout, surge in sales in the first year and
               monetary value of the average purchase.We observed a kind
               of?triple jeopardy?in that the more valuable cohort proved to be
               better on the three most critical factors.",

               paradigm of customer-base analysis by integrating regularity in
               interpurchase timing in a modeling framework. By definition,
               regularity implies less variation in timing patterns and thus
               better predictability. Whereas most stochastic customer behavior
               models assume a Poisson process of ?random? purchase occurrence,
               allowing for regularity in the purchase timings is beneficial in
               noncontractual settings because it improves inferences about
               customers? latent activity status. This especially applies to
               those valuable customers who were previously very frequently
               active but have recently exhibited a longer purchase hiatus. A
               newly developed generalization of the well-known Pareto/NBD model
               accounts for varying degrees of regularity across customers by
               replacing the NBD component with a mixture of gamma distributions

               incorporating regularity on forecasting accuracy using an
               extensive simulation study and a range of empirical applications.
               Even for mildly regular timing patterns, it is possible to
               improve customer-level predictions; the stronger the regularity,
               the greater the gain. Furthermore, the cost in terms of data
               requirements is marginal because only one additional summary

               analysis models, such as the Pareto/NBD model and the BG/NBD
               model. Using the information these models provide, customer
               managers should be able to (1) distinguish active customers from
               inactive customers, (2) generate transaction forecasts for
               individual customers and determine future best customers, and (3)
               predict the purchase volume of the entire customer base. However,
               there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as
               these models have not found their way into wide managerial
               application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use
               of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of
               these models when applied to managerial decision making with the
               simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that
               the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic
               models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for
               predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer

               managerial practice with much care. Furthermore, they identify

                   replacing handcrafted features with features that are learned
                   automatically from data. We detail the system deployed at
                   ASOS and show that learning feature representations is a
                   promising extension to the state of the art in CLTV
                   modelling. We propose a novel way to generate embeddings of
                   customers, which addresses the issue of the ever changing
                   product catalogue and obtain a significant improvement over

               noncontractual settings that assume that customers are ?alive?
               for some period of time and then become permanently inactive. The
               best-known such model is the Pareto/NBD, which assumes that
               customer attrition (dropout or ?death?) can occur at any point in
               calendar time. A recent alternative model, the BG/NBD, assumes
               that customer attrition follows a Bernoulli ?coin-flipping?
               process that occurs in ?transaction time? (i.e., after every
               purchase occasion). Although the modification results in a model
               that is much easier to implement, it means that heavy buyers have
               more opportunities to ?die.? In this paper, we develop a model
               with a discrete-time dropout process tied to calendar time.
               Specifically, we assume that every customer periodically ?flips a
               coin? to determine whether she ?drops out? or continues as a
               customer. For the component of purchasing while alive, we
               maintain the assumptions of the Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD models.
               This periodic death opportunity (PDO) model allows us to take a
               closer look at how assumptions about customer death influence
               model fit and various metrics typically used by managers to
               characterize a cohort of customers. When the time period after
               which each customer makes her dropout decision (which we call
               period length) is very small, we show analytically that the PDO
               model reduces to the Pareto/NBD. When the period length is longer
               than the calibration period, the dropout process is ?shut off,?
               and the PDO model collapses to the negative binomial distribution
               (NBD) model. By systematically varying the period length between
               these limits, we can explore the full spectrum of models between
               the ?continuous-time-death? Pareto/NBD and the naïve ?no-death?
               NBD. In covering this spectrum, the PDO model performs at least
               as well as either of these models; our empirical analysis
               demonstrates the superior performance of the PDO model on two
               data sets. We also show that the different models provide
               significantly different estimates of both purchasing-related and
               death-related metrics for both data sets, and these differences
               can be quite dramatic for the death-related metrics. As more
               researchers and managers make managerial judgments that directly
               relate to the death process, we assert that the model employed to
               generate these metrics should be chosen carefully.",

               purchases from a retailer or donations to a nonprofit

               individual may engage with an organization, such as purchasing in

               accurately forecasts the future behavior for both types of
               activities. In addition to finding evidence of coincidence
               between the activities while customers are ?alive,? we find that
               the latent attrition processes are related. This suggests that
               conducting one type of activity is informative of whether

               able to infer the consumer?s latent budgetary constraint using
               only transaction information, thus enabling managers to
               understand the customer?s budgetary constraint without having to
               survey or depend on aggregate measures of budget constraints.
               Using the proposed framework, CPG manufacturers can assess CLV at
               the focal brand level as well as at the category level, a
               departure from CLV literature, which has mostly been firm

              has been the target of a large body of academic research, few have

              degree of uncertainty associated with a customer's expected CLV.
              This is ironic because academics have long known that V(CLV) is
              one of the most important characteristics that defines and
              differentiates customers from one another, affecting firms on many

               in Schmittlein et al. (1987), customer base analysis uses data on
               the frequency, timing, and dollar value of each customer's past
               purchases to infer ? the number of customers currently active, ?
               how that number has changed over time, ? which individual
               customers are most likely still active, ? how much longer each is
               likely to remain an active customer, and ? how many purchases can
               be expected from each during any future time period of interest.
               In this paper we empirically validate the model proposed by
               Schmittlein et al. In doing so, we provide one of the few
               applications of stochastic models to industrial purchase
               processes and industrial marketing decisions. Besides showing
               that the model does capture key aspects of the purchase process,
               we also present a more effective parameter estimation method and
               some results regarding sampling properties of the parameter
               estimates. Finally, we extend the model to explicitly incorporate
               dollar volume of past purchases. Our results indicate that this
               kind of customer base analysis can be both effective in
               predicting purchase patterns and in generating insights into how
               key customer groups differ. The link of both these benefits to

               lead firms to waste resources on inactive customers. We propose a
               parsimonious model that allows direct marketing to impact three
               relevant behaviors in latent attrition models?the frequency with
               which customers conduct transactions, the size of the
               transactions, and the duration for which customers remain active.
               Our model also accounts for how the organization targets its
               direct marketing across individuals and over time. Using donation
               data from a nonprofit organization, we find that direct marketing
               increases donation incidence for active donors. However, our
               analysis also shows that direct marketing has the potential to
               shorten the length of a donor's relationship. We find that our

                   performed by their players. As each player can remain in the
                   game for years, this results in an exceptionally rich dataset
                   that can be used to understand and predict player behavior.
                   In particular, this information may serve to identify the
                   most valuable players and foresee the amount of money they
                   will spend in in-app purchases during their lifetime. This is
                   crucial in free-to-play games, where up to 50\% of the
                   revenue is generated by just around 2\% of the players, the
                   so-called whales. To address this challenge, we explore how
                   deep neural networks can be used to predict customer lifetime
                   value in video games, and compare their performance to
                   parametric models such as Pareto/NBD. Our results suggest
                   that convolutional neural network structures are the most
                   efficient in predicting the economic value of individual
                   players. They not only perform better in terms of accuracy,
                   but also scale to big data and significantly reduce
                   computational time, as they can work directly with raw

                   Moreover, convolutional neural networks are particularly well
                   suited to identify potential whales. Such an early
                   identification is of paramount importance for business
                   purposes, as it would allow developers to implement in-game
                   actions aimed at retaining big spenders and maximizing their

               it is used as a metric in evaluating decisions in the context of
               customer relationship management. For a firm, it is important to
               form some expectations as to the lifetime value of each customer
               at the time a customer starts doing business with the firm, and
               at each purchase by the customer. In this paper, we use a
               hierarchical Bayes approach to estimate the lifetime value of
               each customer at each purchase occasion by jointly modeling the
               purchase timing, purchase amount, and risk of defection from the
               firm for each customer. The data come from a membership-based
               direct marketing company where the times of each customer joining
               the membership and terminating it are known once these events
               happen. In addition, there is an uncertain relationship between
               customer lifetime and purchase behavior. Therefore, longer
               customer lifetime does not necessarily imply higher customer
               lifetime value. We compare the performance of our model with
               other models on a separate validation data set. The models
               compared are the extended NBD?Pareto model, the recency,
               frequency, and monetary value model, two models nested in our
               proposed model, and a heuristic model that takes the average
               customer lifetime, the average interpurchase time, and the
               average dollar purchase amount observed in our estimation sample
               and uses them to predict the present value of future customer
               revenues at each purchase occasion in our hold-out sample. The

               models compared both at predicting customer lifetime value and in
               targeting valuable customers. The results also show that longer
               interpurchase times are associated with larger purchase amounts
               and a greater risk of leaving the firm. Both male and female
               customers seem to have similar interpurchase time intervals and
               risk of leaving; however, female customers spend less compared

               recency/frequency/monetary value (RFM) segmentation framework,
               and its related probability models, remain a CLV mainstay. In
               this article, we demonstrate the deficiency in RFM as a basis for
               summarizing customer history (data compression), and extend the
               framework to include clumpiness (C) by a metric-based approach.
               Our main empirical finding is that C adds to the predictive
               power, above and beyond RFM and firm marketing action, of both
               the churn, incidence, and monetary value parts of CLV. Hence, we
               recommend a significant implementation change: from RFM to RFMC.
               This work is also motivated by noting that although statistical
               models based on RFM summaries can fit well in aggregate, their
               use can lead to significant micro-level (e.g., ranking of

               their buying decision process. Stochastic models of interpurchase
               time, which have been used extensively in the marketing
               literature, are parsimonious, easy to estimate, and usually fit
               and predict the data well. However, there has been a striking
               omission of marketing variables in these models. Because
               empirical evidence suggests that marketing variables, such as
               promotions, can affect consumers? purchase time decisions, the
               author presents a methodology for including such variables in
               these stochastic models. Four commonly used models are discussed:
               exponential, Erlang-2 (no heterogeneity), and these two models
               with gamma heterogeneity. Thus one can include duration
               dependence, heterogeneity, and nonstationarity in the model, and
               also account for right-censored data. Special care is shown to be
               needed when covariates, such as marketing variables, vary over
               time. The models are analytically tractable, which makes their
               estimation and validation simple and fast. An illustration of the
               methodology is provided with scanner panel data for coffee.
               Inclusion of duration dependence, heterogeneity, and marketing
               variables is shown to improve the model's diagnostics, fit, and
               predictions.",

               The application of standard textbook discussions of CLV leads to

               achieve this, customers likely to defect need to be identified so
               that they can be approached with tailored incentives or other
               bespoke retention offers. Such strategies call for predictive
               models capable of identifying customers with higher probabilities

               customer churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at
               the highest risk of churning and targeting retention efforts
               towards them. While there is a vast literature on developing
               churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest
               risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is
               indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field
               experiments with machine learning techniques, the author
               demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk
               of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive
               churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common
               wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes
               futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because
               they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms
               should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed
               heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target
               customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention,
               regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is
               empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than
               the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest
               risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and

               have begun recommending pricing plans to their customers. One
               reason behind this type of retention campaign is that customers
               who subscribe to a plan suitable for them should be less likely
               to churn because they derive greater benefits from the service.
               In this article, the authors examine the effectiveness of such
               retention campaigns using a large-scale field experiment in which
               some customers are offered plan recommendations and some are not.
               They find that being proactive and encouraging customers to
               switch to cost-minimizing plans can, surprisingly, increase
               rather than decrease customer churn: whereas only 6\% of
               customers in the control condition churned during the three
               months following the intervention, 10\% did so in the treatment
               group. The authors propose two explanations for how the campaign
               increased churn, namely, (1) by lowering customers? inertia to
               switch plans and (2) by increasing the salience of past-usage
               patterns among potential churners. The data provide support for
               both explanations. By leveraging the richness of their field

               settings characterized by network externalities, a CRM campaign
               that is aimed at changing the behavior of specific customers
               propagates through the social network, thereby also affecting the
               behavior of nontargeted customers. Using a randomized field
               experiment involving nearly 6,000 customers of a mobile
               telecommunication provider, they find that the social connections
               of targeted customers increase their consumption and become less
               likely to churn, due to a campaign that was neither targeted at
               them nor offered them any direct incentives. The authors estimate
               a social multiplier of 1.28. That is, the effect of the campaign
               on first-degree connections of targeted customers is 28\% of the

               in activity among the nontargeted but connected customers is
               driven by the increase in communication between the targeted
               customers and their connections, making the local network of the
               nontargeted customers more valuable. These findings suggest that
               in targeting CRM marketing campaigns, firms should consider not
               only the profitability of the targeted customer but also the

               companies face the possibility of both observed and unobserved
               customer attrition (i.e., ?overt? and ?silent? churn) in the same
               pool of customers. This is the case for many online-based
               services where customers have the choice to stop interacting with
               the firm either by formally terminating the relationship (e.g.,
               canceling their account) or by simply ignoring all communications
               coming from the firm. The standard contractual versus
               noncontractual categorization of customer?firm relationships does
               not apply in such hybrid settings, which means the standard
               models for analyzing customer attrition do not apply. We propose
               a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to capture silent and
               overt churn. We apply our modeling framework to two different
               contexts?a daily deal website and a performing arts organization.
               In contrast to previous studies that have not separated the two
               types of churn, we find that overt churners in these hybrid
               settings tend to interact more, rather than less, with the firm
               prior to churning; that is, in settings where both types of churn
               are present, a high level of activity?such as customers actively
               opening emails received from the firm?is not necessarily a good
               indicator of future engagement; rather it is associated with
               higher risk of overt churn. We also identify a large number of
               ?silent churners? in both empirical applications?customers who
               disengage with the company very early on, rarely exhibit any type
               of activity, and almost never churn overtly. Furthermore, we show
               how the two types of churners respond very differently to the
               firm?s communications, implying that a common retention strategy
               for proactive churn management is not appropriate in these hybrid
               settings. Data and the online appendix are available at

  abstract = "Managing customers effectively is crucial for firm’s long-term
              profitability. By understanding differences across customers,
              firms can tailor their activities towards those customers for whom
              the intervention will pay off, therefore increasing the value of
              customers while maximizing the return on the marketing efforts.
              Targeting effectively ultimately depends in the firm’s ability to
              precisely estimate differences across customers—a very difficult
              task when firms attempt to manage recently-acquired customers for
              whom only the first purchase has been observed. We propose a model
              that allows marketers to form “first impressions” of customers
              right after having been acquired. We define a first impression as
              an inference (based on the observed behaviors at the moment of
              acquisition) that the firm makes about customer’s traits that are
              relevant for the firm (e.g., whether the customer will purchase
              again, how s/he will respond to specific marketing actions).The
              main aspect of the model is that it captures latent dimensions
              that impact both the variety of behaviors collected at acquisition
              as well as future propensities to buy and to respond to marketing
              actions. Using probabilistic machine learning, we combine deep
              exponential families with the demand model, relating behaviors
              observed in the first purchase with consequent customer behavior.
              We first demonstrate that such a model is flexible enough to
              capture a wide range of heterogeneity structures (both linear and
              non-linear), thus being applicable to a variety of behaviors and
              contexts. We also demonstrate the model’s ability to handle large
              amounts of data while overcoming commonly faced challenges such as
              data redundancy, missing data, and the presence of irrelevant
              information. We then apply the model to data from a retail context
              and illustrate how the focal firm could form customers' first
              impressions by merely using its transactional database. We show
              that the focal firm would significantly improve the return on
              their marketing actions if it targeted just-acquired customers
              based on their first impressions.",

               equity come to the fore. Any serious attempt to quantify customer
               equity requires modeling techniques that can provide accurate
               multiperiod forecasts of customer behavior. Although a number of
               researchers have explored the problem of modeling customer churn
               in contractual settings, there is surprisingly limited research
               on the modeling of usage while under contract. The present work
               contributes to the existing literature by developing an
               integrated model of usage and retention in contractual settings.
               The proposed method fully leverages the interdependencies between
               these two behaviors even when they occur on different time scales
               (or ?clocks?), as is typically the case in most
               contractual/subscription-based business settings. We propose a
               model in which usage and renewal are modeled simultaneously by
               assuming that both behaviors reflect a common latent variable
               that evolves over time. We capture the dynamics in the latent
               variable using a hidden Markov model with a heterogeneous
               transition matrix and allow for unobserved heterogeneity in the
               associated usage process to capture time-invariant differences
               across customers. The model is validated using data from an
               organization in which an annual membership is required to gain
               the right to buy its products and services. We show that the
               proposed model outperforms a set of benchmark models on several
               important dimensions. Furthermore, the model provides several
               insights that can be useful for managers. For example, we show
               how our model can be used to dynamically segment the customer
               base and identify the most common ?paths to death? (i.e., stages
               that customers go through before churn).",

  abstract = "Uplift modeling has received increasing interest in both the
              business analytics research community and the industry as an
              improved paradigm for predictive analytics for data-driven
              operational decision-making. The literature, however, does not
              provide conclusive empirical evidence that uplift modeling
              outperforms predictive modeling. Case studies that directly
              compare both approaches are lacking, and the performance of
              predictive models and uplift models as reported in various
              experimental studies cannot be compared indirectly since different
              evaluation measures are used to assess their performance.
              Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation metric
              called the maximum profit uplift (MPU) measure that allows
              assessing the performance in terms of the maximum potential profit
              that can be achieved by adopting an uplift model. This measure,
              developed for evaluating customer churn uplift models, extends the
              maximum profit measure for evaluating customer churn prediction
              models. While introducing the MPU measure, we describe the
              generally applicable liftup curve and liftup measure for
              evaluating uplift models as counterparts of the lift curve and
              lift measure that are broadly used to evaluate predictive models.
              These measures are subsequently applied to assess and compare the
              performance of customer churn prediction and uplift models in a
              case study that applies uplift modeling to customer retention in
              the financial industry. We observe that uplift models outperform
              predictive models and lead to improved profitability of retention
              campaigns.",

               promotions. However, a crucial challenge is to retain the
               customers acquired with these free trials. To address this
               challenge, firms need to understand how free-trial customers
               differ from regular customers in terms of their decisions to
               retain the service. This article conceptualizes how marketing
               communication and usage behavior drive customers? retention
               decisions and develops hypotheses about the impact of free-trial
               acquisition on this process. To test the hypotheses, the authors
               model a customer's retention and usage decisions, distinguishing
               usage of a flat-rate service and usage of a pay-per-use service.
               The model allows for unobserved heterogeneity and corrects for
               selection effects and endogeneity. Using household panel data
               from a digital television service, the authors find systematic
               behavioral differences that cause the average customer lifetime
               value of free-trial customers to be 59\% lower than that of
               regular customers. However, free-trial customers are more
               responsive to marketing communication and usage rates, which
               offers opportunities to target marketing efforts and enhance
               retention rates, customer lifetime value, and customer equity.",

  abstract = "Customer defection threatens many industries, prompting companies
              to deploy targeted, proactive customer retention programs and
              offers. A conventional approach has been to target customers
              either based on their predicted churn probability, or their
              responsiveness to a retention offer. However, both approaches
              ignore that some customers contribute more to the profitability of
              retention campaigns than others. This study addresses this problem
              by defining a profit-based loss function to predict, for each
              customer, the financial impact of a retention intervention. This
              profit-based loss function aligns the objective of the estimation
              algorithm with the managerial goal of maximizing the campaign
              profit. It ensures (1) that customers are ranked based on the
              incremental impact of the intervention on churn and post-campaign
              cash flows, after accounting for the cost of the intervention and
              (2) that the model minimizes the cost of prediction errors by
              penalizing customers based on their expected profit lift. Finally,
              it provides a method to optimize the size of the retention
              campaign. Two field experiments affirm that our approach leads to
              significantly more profitable campaigns than competing models.",

               While accurately predicting customer churn probability is

               managers to make optimal decisions. Hence, the current study
               focuses on the relationship between retention incentives and
               profit maximisation. Specifically, we improve existing churn
               management practices by: (1) allowing for customer heterogeneity
               in incentive redemption behaviour, (2) introducing the dependence
               of the probability of accepting an incentive on its monetary
               value, and (3) offering an improved model for developing
               retention campaigns. We support our conclusions with empirical
